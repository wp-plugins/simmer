Simmer is a recipe publishing tool for WordPress.

== Description ==

We all love the simple, human act of sharing how to prepare a favorite meal. Simmer enables WordPress users to quickly and easily publish their recipes with minimal hassle. With a focus on the key areas necessary for a great recipe & food data publishing experience, Simmer stays lightweight and easy to use. Check out Simmer for Recipes in a [live demo](http://demo.simmerwp.com).

**Elegant UI**

Add ingredients, step-by-step instructions, sub-headings, structured cook times, and a lot more all within a user-friendly drag and drop interface.

**Food Data Discovery**

Simmer automatically bakes semantic structure and [schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata in to the core of every recipe you publish. This allows Google to standardize and serve your recipes across a variety of devices and platforms. In addition, our easy to understand recipe index structure allows you to create endless libraries and collections of specific recipes.

**Easily Extendable**

Simmer is built with developers in mind. Utilize the many actions and filters detailed in the [Developer API](http://develop.simmerwp.com) to customize Simmer to fit any project. Or, check out the official [Add-Ons Library](https://simmerwp.com/extensions/) to find an extension (including content e-commerce) that meets your needs. Check back often as new extensions are always being developed!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a way to add an ingredient without adding a numerical value or measurement to it? (For instance, if an ingredient is to be added "to taste" or is optional.) =

Yes! Simply leave any measurement fields that you don't need blank, and they won't be included in your recipe at all. Then, write in "to taste" or any other instructions in the recipe name line itself or in your instructions.

= Can I change the wording used in the "add an ingredient" section? ie: a splash, a drop in the Misc. category? =

Yes. This labelling can be changed very easily through your [Simmer settings](https://simmer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203867035-Configuring-Simmer-Settings).

= Can I add things like cook time and prep time to my recipes? =

Yes, Simmer provides a number of customized options for each recipe to provide metadata, including an attribution link back to an original recipe author if you'd like to include one.

= Can I use Simmer for e-commerce? =

Yes, with the Tinypass for Simmer extension (coming soon) you can easily monetize your media business or blog through micro payments. [Find out more from Tinypass](http://tinypass.com/).
