Simmer is a recipe app on the WordPress platform for people who love to create & market things with food & drink.

== Description ==

Simmer is a recipe app on the WordPress platform for people who love to create or market products with food & drink media. We all love the simple, human act of sharing how to prepare a favorite meal.

**Standardized Recipe Data for the Semantic Web**

Add ingredients, step-by-step instructions, sub-headings, structured cook times, and a lot more all within a simple, user friendly, drag and drop interface. Reorder with ease, and think critically about how you’re compiling content for your target audiences every step of the way.

**Simplicity**

Simmer seamlessly fits within the existing structure and style of WordPress, so you'll barely notice it’s even a 3rd party plugin. Our team of leading user interface (UI) experts continually works to polish every part of the overall user experience for our customers as a part of our active, frequent release schedule, ensuring Simmer will always remain fluid, secure, and as close to flawless as we can achieve.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a way to add an ingredient without adding a numerical value or measurement to it? (For instance, if an ingredient is to be added "to taste" or is optional.) =

Yes! Simply leave any measurement fields that you don't need blank, and they won't be included in your recipe at all. Then, write in "to taste" or any other instructions in the recipe name line itself or in your instructions.

= Can I change the wording used in the "add an ingredient" section? ie: a splash, a drop in the Misc. category? =

Yes. This labelling can be changed very easily through your [Simmer settings](https://simmer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203867035-Configuring-Simmer-Settings).

= Can I add things like cook time and prep time to my recipes? =

Yes, Simmer provides a number of customized options for each recipe to provide metadata, including an attribution link back to an original recipe author if you'd like to include one.

= Can I use Simmer for e-commerce? =

Yes, with the Tinypass for Simmer extension (coming soon) you can easily monetize your media business or blog through micro payments. [Find out more from Tinypass](http://tinypass.com/).
